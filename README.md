This package leverages the [FourierFlows.jl] framework to provide modules for solving problems in
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics on periodic domains using Fourier-based pseudospectral methods.

## Installation

To install, do

```julia
] add GeophysicalFlows
```

The most recent version of GeophysicalFlows.jl requires Julia v1.5 or later.

GeophysicalFlows.jl v0.8.5 is the last version compatible with Julia v1.4.

The latest version that is compatible with Julia v1.0.5 (the current long-term-release) is GeophysicalFlows.jl v0.5.1.


## Examples

See `examples/` for example scripts. These examples are best viewed by browsing them within 
the package's [documentation]. 

Some animations created with GeophysicalFlows.jl are [online @ youtube].


## Modules

* `TwoDNavierStokes`: the two-dimensional vorticity equation.
* `SingleLayerQG`: the barotropic or equivalent-barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, which 
  generalizes `TwoDNavierStokes` to cases with topography, Coriolis parameters of the form 
  `f = f‚ÇÄ + Œ≤y`, and finite Rossby radius of deformation.
* `MultiLayerQG`: a multi-layer quasi-geostrophic model over topography and with the ability 
  to impose a zonal flow `U_n(y)` in each layer.
* `SurfaceQG`: a surface quasi-geostrophic model.
* `BarotropicQGQL`: the quasi-linear barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation.
