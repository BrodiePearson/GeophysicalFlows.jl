# SurfaceQG Module

### Basic Equations

This module solves the non-dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation for surface buoyancy $b_s=b(x,y,z=0)$ described in Capet et al., 2008. The buoyancy and fluid motion at the surface are related through streamfunction $\psi$ as $(u_s, \upsilon_s, b_s) = (-\partial_y\psi, \partial_x\psi, -\partial_z\psi)$. This model solves the time evolution of the surface buoyancy,

$$\partial_t b_s + \mathsf{J}(\psi, b_s) = \underbrace{-\nu(-1)^{n_\nu} \nabla^{2n_\nu}
	b_s}_{\textrm{buoyancy diffusion}} + \underbrace{f}_{\textrm{forcing}}.$$

The evolution of buoyancy is only solved for the surface layer, but $b_s$ is a function of the vertical gradient of $\psi$. In the SQG system, the potential vorticity in the interior of the flow is identically zero. That is, relative vorticity is identical and opposite to the vertical stretching of buoyancy layers,


$$0 = \underbrace{(\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2) \psi}_{\textrm{relative vorticity}} + \underbrace{\partial_z^2 \psi}_{\textrm{stretching term}} .$$


with the boundary conditions $b_s = -\partial_z \psi|_{z=0}$ and $\psi\rightarrow 0$ as $z \rightarrow -\infty$.

These equations describe a system where the streamfunction (and hence the dynamics) at all depths is prescribed entirely by the surface buoyancy. In horizontal spectral space $(k,l,z)$ this relation is



where $K=\sqrt{k^2+l^2}$ and $\widehat{\cdot}$ denotes a horizontal Fourier transform.

### Implementation

The equation is time-stepped forward in Fourier space:

$$\partial_t \widehat{b_s} = \underbrace{- \widehat{\mathsf{J}(\psi, b_s)}}_{\textrm{Non-linear term \mathcal{N}(\widehat{b_s})} - \underbrace{\nu k^{2n_\nu}  \widehat{b_s}}_{\textrm{Linear term} \mathcal{L}}  + \widehat{f}\ .$$

In doing so the Jacobian is computed in the conservative form: $\mathsf{J}(f,g) =
\partial_y [ (\partial_x f) g] -\partial_x[ (\partial_y f) g]$.

Thus:
$$ \widehat{u} = \frac{il}{K}\widehat{b_s}, \qquad \widehat{v} = -\frac{ik}{K}\widehat{b_s} ,$$
$$\mathcal{L} = \beta\frac{\mathrm{i}k_x}{k^2} - \mu - \nu k^{2n_\nu}\ ,$$
$$\mathcal{N}(\widehat{b_s}) = - \mathrm{i}k_x \mathrm{FFT}(u q)-
	\mathrm{i}k_y \mathrm{FFT}(\upsilon q)\ .$$
